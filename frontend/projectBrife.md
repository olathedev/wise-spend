# 🎯 WiseSpend: The Problem We're Solving

## 💡 The Core Insight

**"Most people don't have an earning problem—they have a spending awareness problem."**

## 📊 The Data Behind the Crisis

### 🚨 Emergency Savings Crisis (2025)

59% of Americans cannot afford a $1,000 emergency expense , and only around one-third of Americans would pay a surprise $1,000 expense with savings .

**What this means:**
- People are earning money
- People have goals
- But they can't bridge the gap between income and security

More than 2 in 3 people (69%) would be very or somewhat worried they wouldn't be able to cover their immediate living expenses over the next month if they were to lose a primary source of household income .

---

### 💳 The Spending Blindspot

33% of Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings .

**The pattern:**
1. People make money
2. People want to save
3. Money disappears into "invisible spending"
4. Goals get pushed further away

44% of Americans think their finances will improve in 2025 , yet the most common main financial goal cited by Americans for 2025 is paying down debt (21%), followed by saving more for emergencies (12%) and budgeting spending better (10%) .

**The disconnect:** People WANT to improve, but lack the tools to see WHERE their money is actually going.

### 🎯 New Year's Resolutions = Financial Goals

Of those who identified a financial goal for 2025, 43% say that it's a New Year's resolution they'll address immediately .

**The hackathon brief asks us to help people achieve New Year's resolutions. The data shows:**
- Financial goals ARE the #1 New Year's resolution category
- People are motivated RIGHT NOW (January 2026)
- But they lack awareness of what's holding them back

## 🔬 Why Traditional Budgeting Apps Fail

### The Financial Literacy Gap

Research shows that financial literacy has a direct impact on spending habits, confirming that financial behavior acts as a mediator .

**Translation:** 
- Knowing facts about money ≠ Changing behavior
- People need to UNDERSTAND their patterns, not just see numbers
- Awareness drives behavior change

57% of Gen Z don't have sufficient savings or funds to cover at least three months of expenses, which indicates a need for continued financial support .

**The problem isn't knowledge—it's application.**

## 💬 What Financial Experts Say

### Warren Buffett on Spending Habits

One of the world's wealthiest investors emphasizes the core problem:

> "Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving." 
> — Warren Buffett

Buffett warns: "Most behavior is habitual, and they say that the chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are too heavy to be broken." 

**WiseSpend's solution:** Make invisible spending patterns visible BEFORE they become unbreakable habits.

### On Credit Card Debt

Buffett once said about credit cards: "Interest rates are very high on credit cards. Sometimes they are 18%. Sometimes they are 20%. If I borrowed money at 18% or 20%, I'd be broke." 

**Yet 33% of Americans have more credit card debt than savings.**

## 🎭 The Real-World Context: Who We're Building For

### Target Users: Income Earners with Goals

Based on our research, WiseSpend is for:

1. **Business owners and income earners** who have money coming in but struggle to track where it goes
2. **Young professionals (Gen Z & Millennials)** who despite open communication of budgeting and financial crisis among peers and friend groups, 57% don't have sufficient savings 
3. **Anyone with a New Year's financial resolution** (43% of Americans with financial goals)

**These people don't have an earning problem. They have a SPENDING AWARENESS problem.**

---

## 🧠 The Behavioral Psychology Problem

### Pattern Blindness

Restaurants and bars have become the first expense consumers cut when tightening their budgets, with 38% of Americans spending less in this category .

**Why?** Because when forced to look, people SEE the pattern.

**WiseSpend's approach:** Don't wait for a crisis. Show patterns in real-time.

### The Mediation Effect

Financial behavior exercises a strong mediation effect on the relationship between financial literacy and spending, with a mediation coefficient of 0.797 .

**Translation:**
- Knowledge alone doesn't change spending
- BEHAVIOR is the bridge
- Apps need to change behavior, not just provide information
