# WiseSpend — Pitch Deck

## Page 1 — The Problem

**People don't see the cost of their spending until it's too late.**

- "I'll track it manually" → abandoned after a few days
- Budget apps show numbers, not meaning. You see "$6.50 coffee" but not what you give up for it
- By the time you notice the pattern, the damage is done

**The real gap:** No one connects today's purchase to tomorrow's goal. That $6.50 latte isn't just coffee. It's 15 minutes of retirement, or a couple of weeks further from a house deposit. Most tools never make that link.

## Page 2 — Why This Matters

**Money stress is a behavior problem, not a math problem.**

People know they should save. They don't lack information. They lack *moment-of-purchase* awareness. Small, repeated choices add up, but most apps only show the total after the fact.

WiseSpend targets the moment you're about to spend—or right after—when a clear, personal nudge can change behavior. One insight at the right time can shift dozens of future purchases.

## Page 3 — The Solution

**We connect every purchase to your goals—at the moment you make it.**

Instead of tracking numbers in a void, WiseSpend shows the real trade-off: *"That $100 dinner pushes your house deposit back 2 weeks."* Instead of generic advice, an AI coach asks: *"Is that worth delaying your goal?"*

The solution is twofold: (1) **visibility** — you see what each purchase costs in terms you care about, and (2) **reflection** — the coach asks questions that make you think, not commands that make you feel guilty.

## Page 4 — How It Works

1. **Scan** — Upload a receipt. Gemini vision extracts items and context (necessity vs. discretionary).
2. **Connect** — Each purchase is linked to your goals (emergency fund, house, debt, etc.).
3. **Coach** — The AI asks targeted questions instead of giving generic advice.
4. **Repeat** — Over time, you see patterns (e.g., Friday convenience spending) and adjust.

The receipt scan isn't about that one purchase. It's about making the next hundred different.
